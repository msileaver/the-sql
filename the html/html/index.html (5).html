<h1 style="font: size 50px; text-align:center;">the game we are making is called the rot factory
chapter 1 the memory as per pc requirements are intel core i5 8th gen(gb supports nvida and other grapics less gb 5 or 12)
so the story of the game

<p>so one day you will be comeing back from home with your car
you get very tired and get like sleeping ane then you meet with terriable accendent and wake again you dont knowing what happed 
and then you see your childhood factory! its abooned why beause when the sprite factory used to be popular 
at daylight everthig is fine but on night kids screaming would be hear beacuse they used to kidnap the kids how rich kids would buy
there expensive toys and food when they would buy the expensive toys and food they are kidnap by the mosters these plushies monster
are so big like the avrage panda size most of them have hands so its easy to cath them each of these pushies are of sam(r) wich have bags that are little bigger than
sam(r) they make the plushies's bag the size of the kids how the bags of sam(r) are very streachable so it can fit a 11 year old  
and then they would go missing like 1 min before they exit if they are near the exit the toy would kidnap the kids thus you decide to go to see
and we cant reavel the game but we cant reavel whats going to happen next when game is published yall is goona see what happed next</p>
